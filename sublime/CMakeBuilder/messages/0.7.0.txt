NEW features:

- Diagnose command if you get stuck on what to do
- Syntax highlighting for the CMakeCache.txt file
- Syntax highlighting for the cmake output panel at the configuration step
- Goto error/warning at the configuration step (press F4)

The supplied in-line message for the "goto error/warning" is kind of bonkers.
That's because Sublime Text 3 cannot handle multi-line error messages; see for
example [1] or [2]. Anyway, that's the best I can do for now.
