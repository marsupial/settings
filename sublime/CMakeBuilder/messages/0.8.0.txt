- Fix bug where if you didn't have the "command_line_overrides" key in the
  cmake dictionary you'd get an exception.

- Add settings file (go to Preferences -> Package Settings -> CMakeBuilder)

- The following settings are available as options in the settings file:

  - write_build_targets_after_successful_configure (boolean)
  - silence_developer_warnings                     (boolean)
  - always_clear_cache_before_configure            (boolean)
  - configure_on_save                              (boolean)
  - ctest_command_line_args                        (string)

  Refer to the package settings for more details.

- With the settings present, some commands are now obsolete. They are:
  
  - Configure (Silence Dev Warnings)
    You can set silence_developer_warnings to true in your settings
    file for the same effect.

  - Configure & Update Build System Targets
    You can set write_build_targets_after_successful_configure to true in
    your settings file for the same effect.

  - Run CTest (Verbose), Run CTest (Extra Verbose)
    You can set ctest_command_line_args to "--output-on-failure -VV".

  These three commands will dissapear in 0.9 (current version is 0.8).

- Separate generators into platform-specific python packages.
  In the directory Packages/CMakeBuilder/Generators, we now have a Python
  file for each generator. That is, we define a one-to-one correspondence
  between pyfiles in those directories and platform-specific generators.

- Add "Visual Studio" and "NMake Makefiles" generators for Windows.
  Yes, there's Windows support now. Hello, windows users! I haven't
  updated the package control channel yet, so they'll have to wait a bit
  longer. But the functionality is present.

- Rewrite README.md for new users.

- Add CONTRIBUTING.md file.
