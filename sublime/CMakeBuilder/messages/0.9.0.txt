Dear earlybirds,

This is version 0.9 of CMakeBuilder. I believe it has reached a mature
state, so it's almost ready for version 1.0. There are a couple things
left to do, like make the NMake output a little better by filtering out
the ansi color codes. On the other hand, NMake is not multithreaded, so
I'm not sure if anybody in good conscience wants to use this generator.

- Fix write_build_targets overwriting all of your other build systems.

  Previously, all other build systems that were present got overwritten.
  This is no longer the case; all your custom-written build systems
  remain intact.

  !!! IMPORTANT !!!

  The new behaviour of write_build_targets is such that
  it will probably create a new build system alongside your old one.
  It's best to remove your old build system and generate a new one. The
  new build system will update itself and not overwrite other build
  build systems.

- Allow custom name for your new build system.

  This is realized as a new setting called

    "generated_name_for_build_system"

  By default, its value is "${project_base_name} (${platform})". When
  combined with the above fix, this allows multiple build systems (per
  platform) to live inside a single sublime project file. Thus, it should
  be possible to have a single cross-platform sublime project file now.

- Remove deprecated commands.

  Use the settings, Luke!

- Uniformize getting settings

  Every setting can be overridden in the "settings" dictionary of your
  sublime project file. For instance, if you want
  "silence_developer_warnings" to be off by default, but not for a
  particular project, you can do so in the settings of the project file.

- Add a link to the README in the preferences like a pro.
