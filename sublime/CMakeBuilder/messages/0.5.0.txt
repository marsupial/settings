* Added new commands:
  - "Clear Cache": Removes all cmake-related files
    (thanks, github.com/eugene-babichenko !)
  - "Clear Cache & Configure": Simply runs the commands "Clear Cache" and
    "Configure" one after the other. This command does NOT ask for confirmation
    for deleting the cmake-related cache files.

* If a prerequisite for a command is not satisfied, the command will not be
  executable. For instance, if you're not in "project mode" and you don't have
  a "cmake" dictionary in your project file, the "Configure" command will just
  not show up in the Command Palette. Similarly, if the project has not yet
  been configured, you cannot write build targets to your project file.

* All commands are now also in the "Tools" menu at the top of the screen.

* If the generator is "make" (the default), then building the default ("all")
  target will now build with the max number of cores of your machine by default.
