Hi there!

It's probably been a while since you heard from me. I have been working on
getting the server functionality to work for this plugin. It is currently in an
alpha state, and should work for OSX and Linux. Windows users should not yet
try this out.

If you have CMake >= 3.7, and you want to test out the server functionality,
then I have news for you. I have prepared an alpha version of CMakeBuilder 2.0
on Package Control that you can test.

Please read the updated README at github.com/rwols/CMakeBuilder to learn how
to make Package Control download 2.0.0-alpha. I would be forever grateful if
you could try it out and report any issues.

Version 2 will have awesome new features, including:
- Clever target handling,
- No more custom build systems in your sublime-project, everything is
  transparent now,
- CMakeBuilder knows all of your include directories and can report it,
- CMakeBuilder enhances your compile_commands.json with header info,
- Can copy compile_commands.json to your project root folder if you want,
- CMakeBuilder will fill in the details of EasyClangComplete for you,
- You can "Build & Run" targets with help of the TerminalView plugin,
- Our hand-made generator handling will be obsolete, the server handles that,
- Multiple "schemes": Release builds, Debug builds, MinSizeRel builds, the
  sky is the limit.
- Maybe more!

Thanks, and have a nice day!
