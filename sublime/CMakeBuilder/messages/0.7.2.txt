The problem with the syntax files was that CMakeBuilder got installed in the
"Installed Packages" directory, while syntax paths were supplied as
"Packages/Syntax/some-syntax.sublime-syntax", so users got errors complaining
about missing syntax files when building. This was patched by adding a
.no-sublime-package file in the root directory. This is patch #2.

If the error persists, please reinstall from package control. CMakeBuilder
should install in your "Packages" directory now, not in "Installed Packages".
