Tell choose if your issue is a question, bug or suggestion, then replace the instructions below with your request:

### Question:

*Questions (if complete) are welcome here, although we also have chat at [http://gitter.im/SublimeLSP](http://gitter.im/SublimeLSP)*

### Bug:

*Consult the [Troubleshooting guide](https://lsp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#troubleshooting) for tips and solutions for common problems.*

*Is it a language server problem? The LSP package can do little to prevent slowness or missing content - you may want to create an issue for them instead.*

*Please include in your report:*

* OS and language server
* How you installed LSP (Package Control or from git?)
* Minimal reproduction steps
* Log (trimmed)


### Suggestion:

*Please read the [Contributor Guidelines](https://github.com/tomv564/LSP/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Specifically, LSP avoids building functionality that does not exist in Sublime Text, or that serves only one language.*
