=> 0.7.0

Features:
* Support for multiple services per window and document (much help from @Kronuz)
  * LSP will start server & sync for every enabled config with matching syntax.
  * Other commands (eg. completion) will prefer the first / most relevant scope.
* Support for multiple languageIds per server (@Kronuz)
* Config syntaxes can be shorted to eg. "Julia" instead of the full syntax name.
* Support newer documentChanges structure (without checking version) for applying edits
* Greatly improved UI for Rename symbol (@predagnikolic)
* Optionally use completion textEdit to (@nanoant)
* Connect to tcp server without starting the server

Bug fixes:
* Diagnostic messages were not displayed correctly (HTML escaping)
* Completions more reliable by using same value for trigger and content.
* Properly unload panels, regions and phantoms when package is unloaded / uninstalled.

Under the hood, more unit testing and in-sublime testing and increased typing coverage.

Plus more contributions, both code, bug reports and suggestions, all very much appreciated!
