- Fix missing encoding attribute for Sublime Text builds 3153 and higher.
- The "TARGET" notification in the status bar now displays once you configured.
- Present a list of targets once configured succesfully.
- Better diagnostic message when trying to build a cmake target that fails.
- Account for protocol version 1.1.
- The lowest ST build that I'm willing to support is probably going to be 3153,
  due to how Default.exec.ProcessListener was changed a bit in that version.
  Most people will have a sufficiently high version once I release this on
  Package Control I believe.
