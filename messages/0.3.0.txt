=> 0.3.0

This release changes how language server configuration is read, please review your settings if language servers are not starting up as expected.

Client configurations are now inherited from default_clients settings and can be explicitly enabled or disabled globally or per project using the 'enabled' field.

When a supported file is opened, "Enable Language Server" commands are available in the command palette - these will write the 'enabled' setting and start/stop the server as needed.

An 'env' field was added for passing environment variables to the language server process

Many bug fixes, especially around troubleshooting configuration/startup failures.

See https://github.com/tomv564/LSP/releases/tag/0.3.0 for full update details.

Many thanks to those reporting issues and bugs, and a special thanks to the contributors of this release!
