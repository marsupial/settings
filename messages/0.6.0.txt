* Added more strict checks for variable substitutions
  
  This should take care of subtle typo's in your cmake dictionary of your
  sublime-project file.
  (thanks, github.com/eugene-babichenko !)

* Added new command (and variations): "Run CTest"

  If you have unit tests defined with the "add_test" command from CMake, you can
  run those tests by executing the commmand "Run CTest", either from the command
  palette or from the "Tools -> CMakeBuilder" menu at the top of the window.
  This command is only available when your build folder is populated with cmake-
  related files.
